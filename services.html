                    <h4>French Polishing</h4>
                    <p>
                        At the most basic level, French polish is a decorative coating applied to a surface. With sufficient work the polish becomes an integral part of the wood – this allows the polish to stand out from other surface coatings.
                        <br><br>
                        There are several ways French polish can be applied such as brushed on or having numerous coats applied with a polishing mop for best results. At D&G polishing we have years of experience within the French Polishing industry and know the best methods and products to ensure the end result is perfect.
                        <br><br>
                        D&G Polishing provide a full range of wood finishing and French Polishing services, our services range from traditional French polishing to the latest and more modern spray finishes.

                    <h4>Furniture Restoration</h4>
                    <p>
                        For many, buying new furniture isn’t always an option – this could be because it can be quite costly or maybe you’ve got a piece that is too special to you to get rid of. At D&G polishing we have years of experience restoring furniture.
                        <br><br>
                        Furniture is usually sent to us with issues such as watermarks on colour staining issues we’re experts in strip and re-polishing to give any piece of a furniture an overhaul. We can do this too, by using our expert wood colour matching service if you wish to keep your original colour, or if you’re looking to change the colour completely we have a huge range of colours to pick from.
                        <br><br>
                        Some furniture restoration can be much smaller with pieces needing small repairs to the woodwork or issues such as removing cup rings from the countertop.
                        <br><br>
                        If you would like a price for your furniture restoration you can send us images or a video of what you would like changed, we can then work on giving you an estimated cost before reviewing the piece in person.
